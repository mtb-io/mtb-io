# 🧪 mtb

Builder. Tinkerer. Agent wrangler.  
Ex Army turned Web3 dev, now running **mtb labs**, where AI, Discord bots, and programmable data collide.

Currently building:
- ⚙️ **odin** - agentic AI infrastructure with personality and purpose
- 📊 **prism** - Discord analytics, but smarter
- 🛡️ **aegis** - moderation with memory
- 🌐 **nexus** - wallet-based verification for Web3 communities
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **freya** - AI-powered routines for neurodiverse families
- 🧠 **Loki** - narrative intelligence for crypto alpha

## 🧭 What I’m About

- **Web3 with actual utility** (not just JPEGs and vibes)
- **AI that knows when to shut up**
- **Data you own**, not data that owns you
- **Building slow, shipping sharp**
