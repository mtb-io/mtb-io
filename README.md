Builder. Tinkerer. Agent wrangler.  
Ex-Army turned Web3 dev, now running **mtb labs** — where AI, bots, and programmable data collide.

### Currently building

- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **freya** – routines and rhythm for neurodiverse families  
- 🧠 **loki** – real-time alpha fed by sentiment and narrative tracking

- **Web3 that actually does something**
- **AI that understands before answering**
